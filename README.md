## Problem Statement

The Journal of Natural and Applied Sciences (JONAS) publishes multidisciplinary research articles across various disciplines, including environmental science, agriculture, mining, engineering, and water resources. Manually categorizing these articles into their respective disciplines based on titles and abstracts is time-consuming and subjective. An automated classification model is needed to accurately assign articles to their relevant disciplines using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.
