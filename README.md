# 1. Business Understanding

## Problem Statement

The Journal of Natural and Applied Sciences (JONAS) publishes multidisciplinary research articles across various disciplines, including environmental science, agriculture, mining, engineering, and water resources. Manually categorizing these articles into their respective disciplines based on titles and abstracts is time-consuming and subjective. An automated classification model is needed to accurately assign articles to their relevant disciplines using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.

## Business Objectives

The primary business objectives are:

1. Efficient Article Classification – Automate the categorization of journal articles to streamline editorial workflows.
2. Improved Discoverability – Enhance search and retrieval of articles by discipline for researchers and readers.
3. Reduced Manual Effort – Minimize the need for manual tagging by editors, reducing human error and workload.
